        <h2>B.E Project</h2>
        <p>Our objective was to create a <span style="color: aqua;">blockchain technology-based web-application</span> that will act as an alternative to the traditional Authentication scheme for IoT Devices. The model is to <span style="color: rgb(137, 249, 80);">provide enhanced security for IoT devices</span> using Blockchain Technology.This is to provide a secure and decentralized system that can verify the identity of connected devices and <span style="color: red;">ensure that only authorized devices can access the network</span>.By using blockchain technology, it is possible to create a temper proof and transparent ledger of device identities and their associated permissions.
            With blockchain based authentication, there is no single point of failure or vulnerability in the system, as the ledger is distributed across a network nodes.
